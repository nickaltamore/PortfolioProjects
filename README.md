I am a Physics graduate a passion for data and especially in the areas of data analysis and visualisation. After a successful career in education, I am looking to transition to a career in the data industry. During my first career, I have developed a range of key skills, especially the ability to break down difficulty concepts and communicate them effectively, working collaboratively within diverse teams to reach a goal and to face challenges and solve problems calmly and efficiently. 

I am currently engaged in a 12-week intensive Digital Skills Bootcamp in Data with JustIT training. I am looking to build on my skills and develop new skills to develop a career as a data analyst. I have completed several data projects using Excel, SQL, Python, R, Tableau and PowerBI which have been posted in my GitHub and Tableau Public portfolios. 

My immediate aim is to establish myself in a Junior Data Analysis role and work in a team of effective professionals from whom I can learn as much as possible during my first years in the industry. I am looking to use my data skills and problem-solving abilities to meet new challenges head on and contribute to making important data-driven decisions.
