An attempt to use NBA shooting stats to create a dashboard tracking Lebron James, Stephen Curry and James Harden during the 2022/2023 season. 
Data taken from:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhavalrupapara/nba-2023-player-shot-dataset
Created a shot map but positions are only approximate. 
May be some issues with data as the figures derived do not match published stats.
